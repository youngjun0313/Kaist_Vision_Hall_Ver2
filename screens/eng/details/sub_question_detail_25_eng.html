                        Hello, I am Professor Phill-Seung Lee from the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The question we propose for the KAIST Ultimate Questions program is “How can a human brain be connected to a machine to share data?” This is a subject that I have given much thought to over many years, and I have contemplated the importance of such technology. My opinions take a bit of a macroscopic viewpoint.<br>
                        We humans are organisms. There have been forms of life on Earth for millions of years, and we know that all organisms continuously evolve. Recently, humans have risen through the ranks of life on Earth by evolving a strong aptitude for learning. Our ability to learn far exceeds the capabilities of other organisms, and this has led to our rapid development over a short period of time.<br>
                        However, if we start considering the next steps of human evolution, we can see that even our ability to learn is subject to biological limitations. For example, if we learn something, then our children have to learn it again from the beginning, and their children in turn will have to repeat the process. In some sense, this requires unnecessary effort and takes time.<br>
                        Thinking about how we can transcend these limitations, we see that we will ultimately need to overcome our biological limitations. This means we require some kind of connection to machines, the most notable choice being computers. By connecting humans to computers, we could develop at unprecedented rates far exceeding anything seen before in the evolution of life on Earth. Our brains can only interact with the world around us through our senses, but if we were connected to a computer, then we could potentially have an unlimited number of sensory organs that we could communicate with. I believe that such a connection is the only way of transcending being human to elevate ourselves into perhaps some type of cosmic existence. <br>
                        However, it is extremely difficult to connect a human brain to a computer. Humans consist of cells, which are completely different in nature to the electrical integrated circuits that constitute a computer. This poses significant challenges in forming a connection. We would need to be able to read and write the immense amount of data that our brains generate, preferably in real time. More importantly, we must ensure that such a connection does not negatively affect human health.<br>
                        With such an extensive and detailed list of requirements, a lot of effort and time will be needed to develop a suitable connection that satisfies all requirements. Nevertheless, I believe that it is a research subject that should be our ultimate goal. Such research will be both monumental and challenging. We can imagine the implications of the results. While these may seem like outlandish ideas, I strongly believe that this is a research subject that KAIST should focus on for many years to come. I believe it to be suitable as a KAIST Ultimate Question.<br>
