                        For the past century, we have been using copper wires to send electrical currents and  power, and transmit signals. Copper wires are ideal conductors as they possess free electrons, which allow current to flow with minimal loss. However, when free electrons flow  at high frequencies, a changing magnetic field is formed around it. This results in the generation of eddy current that prevents the current flow in the center of the conductor and enhances the surface current. As the resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of a conducting current, the resistance increases as the frequency increases because the current flows mostly along the surface of the wires. Therefore, while transmitting low frequency signals through copper wires is easy enough, we run into several problems when dealing with exceptionally high frequencies. This explains why smartphone accessories do not have long cables, and why HDMI cables become significantly more expensive by the length. I believe that the electrical wires we have been using over the past century were intended by nature for low frequency uses, but not for applications involving high frequencies. Mankind has yet to move on from the use of copper wires that has become closely integrated into our lives and society over the past 100 years. As engineers became more aware of this issue, we managed to develop a new type of wiring for signal transmission: optical fibers. However, optical fibers are almost 100 times more expensive than general electrical wires and are also highly vulnerable to vibrations and heat. Therefore, this technology is insufficient to completely replace conducting wires. This is why my ultimate question challenges mankind to find an inexpensive and stable solution that can replace the century-old technology of copper wires. In other words, my ultimate question is, ‘How can we develop a next-generation wiring that is inexpensive and is capable of transmitting high frequency signals at an incredible speed?‘
