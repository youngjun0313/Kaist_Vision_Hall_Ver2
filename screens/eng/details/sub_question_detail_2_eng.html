                        Humans are multicellular organisms comprised of many different types of cells. Cells are generally several tens of micrometers in length and have evolved to maintain an optimal size according to its functions and the tissue for which it is a part of. Furthermore, organelles within cells also have certain size ranges according to the type and state of the cell. For example, primary cilia, which are organelles that protrude from the cell like antennae, are generally 5 micrometers long. Cells build up tubulin and other proteins to grow the cilia and halt this process when the cilia reach 5 micrometers in length. This demonstrates that cells have the ability to measure size and length. We can also hypothesize that the size information of cells and organelles are stored in genetic information. <br>
                        The measurement of size is simple: we just need to use a ruler. The problem is that it is very unlikely that cells use rulers to measure length. An exception to this can be seen when long proteins are actually used as rulers during the production of muscle fibers that make up muscle tissue. However, this is a very unique case, and most other mechanisms of measurement remain unknown. My ultimate question asks, "how are our cells able to measure size and length at the micrometer level?" and as a follow-up question, "how is size information stored in DNA?" <br>
                        The importance of these questions lies in the fact that many diseases disrupt the size homeostasis of cells and organelles. Cancer cells are identified in biopsies by seeing whether if the cell nucleus has grown abnormally large compared to the size of its cell. Cells have also been reported to grow abnormally large in aging tissue. Furthermore, kidney failure can be caused by abnormally long or short primary cilia of the kidney epithelial cells. Thus, it is vital to determine the mechanisms in which cells control size to better understand the causes and pathological roles of such phenomena. This could also enable us to develop drugs that can target size homeostasis disturbances to either kill cancer cells or slow the aging process. <br>
