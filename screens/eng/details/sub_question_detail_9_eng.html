                        Hello, I am Professor Myungeun Seo of the Department of Chemistry. My research focuses on the study of polymers. Plastic bags that we use every day and proteins inside our body are all polymers: molecules with significantly large molecular weights. Synthetic polymers are crucial materials to our lives as they have properties that proteins do not possess. They are mass produced, can go into organic solvents, and possess a much wider range of mechanical and thermal properties. Although it is clear that synthetic polymers are highly useful materials, it is undeniable that they fall behind in terms of structural complexity compared to proteins. Proteins are composed of 20 different amino acids: the building blocks are elaborately and precisely connected to form a linear sequence in a specific order with a single molecular weight. The protein is then folded into a unique 3-dimensional structure specified by the sequence, that enables it to perform its designated function. Over the past several decades, many have pondered the possibility of achieving such complex levels of synthesis, and this has become somewhat of a holy grail in polymer chemistry. However, with our growing knowledge of proteins in recent years, it is becoming clear that proteins are far more sophisticated than we originally thought. For example, while a synthesized polymer must be processed to control its shape, proteins spontaneously undergo folding to form the 3-dimensional structure as they are being synthesized. Post-translational modification is common in proteins after synthesis to form mature products. Intrinsically disordered proteins do not have a fixed structure, but adapt different structures dynamically to function. Therefore, we have to ask: “Can we synthesize polymers that are as complex and sophisticated as proteins, by utilizing polymerization-induced chain structuring, selective post-polymerization modification reactions, and dynamic structure control?” I believe research on this subject would greatly contribute to the development of novel smart polymers that could be central to our future.
