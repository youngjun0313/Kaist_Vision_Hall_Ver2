                        Hello, I am Hyotcherl Ihee from the Department of Chemistry. <br>
                        My Ultimate Question that I would like to share is whether we can realize desired reactions at a specific point on any molecule at will to synthesize products with high yields.<br>
                        The process of producing compounds that we need is closely related to everyday life. For example, drugs such as aspirin are produced through processes that synthesize chemical molecules. Thus, we can see this purpose at the center of numerous studies carried out by chemists around the world.<br>
                        It is here that I began thinking about what the ultimate endgame would be for this field of study.<br>
                        Thanks to extensive research, we are now able to produce various desired compounds and even macromolecules, such as DNAs and proteins.<br>
                        However, we have yet to achieve the goal of being able to make possible specific reactions at specific locations at will. To explain why this is difficult to achieve, here I have a ball and a pen. I can freely control these objects in any way I like. For example, I can place the pen at the mouth symbol drawn on the ball. However, if we consider molecules instead of these objects, it is difficult to achieve such a high degree of control.<br>
                        It is difficult to trigger reactions at a specific point on a molecule because similar interactions will take place at other points as well. I thus began pondering how such a goal could be achieved. Inside our bodies is a protein called hemoglobin, and like other proteins, it is composed of amino acids. Would it be possible to, for example, trigger any desired reaction at a specific location such as the seventh amino acid of hemoglobin? Could we attach a specific compound of our interest at the location of the seventh amino acid and at only that point? How could we achieve this?<br>
                        This is the question I wanted to share. There has been a case where a single molecule was placed on a surface to cause a reaction at a specific location. However, as this case only dealt with single molecules, it holds little practical merit. Thus, my Ultimate Question asks the following: Can we achieve similar results with a practically meaningful number of molecules to synthesize products in sufficient quantities that can practically benefit our everyday life?<br>
