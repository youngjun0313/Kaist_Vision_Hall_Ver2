                        Hello, I am Professor Seongjun Park from the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering. If I were to summarize my field of research into one term, it would be brain-machine-interface (BMI). As such, the ultimate question I propose is related to how we can connect our brain and nervous system to machines and computers. Many people are skeptical when it comes to the benefits of connecting our brains to machines, but there are many possibilities. For a start, let us consider a patient who suffers from paralysis in his or her limbs. We could potentially connect robotic arms or legs to the brain of this patient, allowing the patient to freely control them as if they were their own limbs. For such patients, the idea alone presents immense hope. As another example, if there are problems with our sensory organs, such as our eyes, ears, or even mouth, we could replace them with machines that serve the same roles, preventing potential disability. An example of this would be a camera that is connected to send electrical signals to the brain of a patient who is blind, serving as a bionic eye. Patients who are mute could have their brains connected to a system that interprets brain signals and uses speakers as artificial voice boxes to enable speech. The opportunities of such interfaces are limitless in terms of overcoming disabilities and assisting in rehabilitation. Going further, given that all of our organs send and receive signals through nerves, if we could control these signals, we would potentially be able to regulate immune responses, control hormone levels, and even treat certain diseases. Therefore, brain-machine interfaces show great promise as a type of ‘bioelectronic medicine’. I believe that a moment will come when we can perfectly integrate humans and machines, starting with areas such as rehabilitation, regeneration, and treatment. I see this as mankind’s second evolution, where we evolve from humans to bionic man.<br>
                        In addition to think about the potential of BMI, we still need to consider the multitude of hurdles that must be overcome to reach such goals. The two most significant issues are as follows. The first is invasiveness. Machines and computers use materials such as metal and silicon, which means there are potential health risks if we install such devices into our body. This is a major issue that necessitates significant improvements in the materials and design of the equipment. The second issue is related to the neural signal recording and analysis. Our brains contain massive amounts of information, which means we need 1) recording technique with extremely high resolution 2) technologies that can process large amounts of data. Substantial research will have to be carried out to resolve these two issues to enable the safe and accurate transfer of data to achieve the integration of machines and humans. This is why I propose the ultimate question, ‘How can we connect our brains to machines?’ to encourage KAIST to find solutions to this problem. Many researchers around the world are conducting extensive brain-related studies in the hopes of realizing advancements that can benefit all mankind. I hope that KAIST can be at the center of this movement, making significant contributions to the grand effort. I too will do my utmost to contribute to this field of research. Thank you.
