                        Hello, I am Professor Poong Hyun Seong of the Department of Nuclear and Quantum Engineering of KAIST. The Ultimate Question that I propose is “What are the ultimate methods of overcoming undesirable human actions that could take place in nuclear power plants?” When I say “undesirable human actions”, I am referring to two types of actions: the first is human error that occurs in nuclear power plants, and the second is cyberattacks by humans on such facilities. Human error is an unintentional human action, whereas cyberattacks are intentional. My ultimate question is not limited to only nuclear power plants. In fact, it can be applied to many fields, such as automobile driving, rail networks, health care, and national defense. However, my main focus is on nuclear power plants, where safety is a particular major concern. <br>
                        Let me explain why undesirable human actions are important matters in nuclear power plants. For a start, human error in nuclear power plants can result in serious accidents. Throughout our history, the three largest accidents that have occurred in nuclear power plants are as follows: the Three Mile Island II accident in the United States, the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan. All three of these accidents were closely connected to human error. In the two-year period from 2010 to 2011, a total of 2379 events occurred in nuclear power plants globally, of which 1149 cases (48%) were related to human error. Simply put, human error occurs frequently in nuclear power plants, and this can lead to massive consequences.<br>
                        How can we overcome these undesirable human errors? This can be achieved through two methods: preventing such undesirable human actions from occurring in the first place, and ensuring minimal consequences even if such actions occur.<br>
                        So then how can we minimize the potential of human error? We can suggest five methods. The first is maximizing automation. However, we are currently not able to automate every single process, and humans will need to be involved in certain stages. Even if full automation is possible, there is still the risk of the automation process failing, at which humans will need to intervene to resolve the issues. In such situations, we can reduce human errors by providing  good human system interfaces and making clear and effective work procedures. We also need to provide top-level training and education to operation and maintenance personnel. Finally we need to enhance safety culture. To reiterate, the five methods are maximizing automation to reduce human error, providing good human-system interfaces, making effective work procedures, providing in-depth training and education, and enhancing safe culture.<br>
                        We also need to think about how we can minimize the consequences of undesirable human actions when they occur. This means that we need to develop systems that can withstand the effects caused by human error or cyberattacks. If we refer to the results of undesirable human actions on systems as “faults”, we should ensure that such faults do not occur within our systems first. This entails developing systems that are highly resistant to faults, for example by using software verification and validation methods or by reducing the potential attack surface. Another dimension to countering faults is being able to quickly identify and resolve faults that occur. This means that we need fast and effective fault detection and remediation methods implemented within our systems. Lastly, we need to develop systems that are not affected by faults caused by human error or cyberattacks even if  faults are not detected or remedied. We refer to this as fault tolerance, and fault tolerant systems are able to operate normally even if faults do occur.<br>
                        In conclusion, my Ultimate Question is “What are the ultimate methods of overcoming undesirable human actions that could take place in nuclear power plants?” I suggested several potential methods to answer this question. However, not only do researchers need to further develop and expand upon these methods, I personally am determined to continue my research to discover new and novel ultimate methods that could lead to major strides in the field. <br>
