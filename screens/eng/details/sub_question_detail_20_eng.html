                        Hello, I am Professor Il-Chul Moon from the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering. My ultimate question asks, ’Is there an ultimate method that can allow Korea’s small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises to gain global competitiveness?‘ Korea’s industrial structure is divided into advanced manufacturing and traditional manufacturing. The former, which has semiconductors and display technology at the forefront, is brimming with world-class technology and innovations. This has enabled Korea to become a leader in these fields. However, the advanced manufacturing industry only accounts for 17% of the total domestic employment in manufacturing. The remaining 83% are employed in the traditional manufacturing industry, where small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises make up the backbone. However, these enterprises are currently being excluded from the 4th Industrial Revolution. For companies that have to focus on staying afloat and profitable, innovations such as AI, digital twin technology, IoT, and big data may seem like distant luxuries. How can we help small and medium-sized traditional manufacturing enterprises adapt to the 4th Industrial Revolution and elevate their competitiveness? Considering the relatively minor investments, short application periods, and poor working environments of small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises, this is a difficult question to answer. If KAIST cannot find a solution to this issue, Korea may find itself with an unusual industrial structure where the country is forced to lean almost exclusively on a small group of advanced manufacturing companies. Therefore, this is not just an ultimate question but an urgent one that requires a solution in the near future.
