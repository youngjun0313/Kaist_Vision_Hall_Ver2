                        Our lab conducts research on the subject of localization. When we talk about localization, it can be either indoor localization or outdoor localization; our lab focuses on the former. In the case of outdoor localization, there are several services that are used around the world, such as GPS and GLONASS-K. In terms of indoor localization, location services are offered through wireless signals and require something known as a radio map. However, the task of generating a radio map is immensely challenging. Therefore, radio maps are automatically generated by gathering signals from numerous unspecified smartphones in a crowdsourcing manner, which is followed by a process involving the automatic labeling of points at which data were collected. This is a task that requires software, and our lab is in the final stages of developing a technology that uses software to generate radio maps.<br>
                        As you are well aware, once the software matures, the next step involves developing hardware. This is the case for both AI and graphics. Even in the case of indoor localization technology, we can transform software into hardware. We are in the process of converting our KAIST indoor locating system, KAILOS, into hardware, which will then be combined with outdoor localization chips for GPS or GLONASS-K to produce a new type of chip. This is a complex process that requires a lot of time and effort. Therefore, this is the ultimate question of our lab, and we are determined to find an ultimate solution.
