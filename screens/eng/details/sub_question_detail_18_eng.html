                        Hello, I am Professor Young-Chul Ghim from the Department of Nuclear & Quantum Engineering of KAIST. The ultimate question I propose is, “How large can we create and maintain a temperature gradient in nature?“ Of course, we should consider such a question without factoring out economic considerations. We may be able to maintain a large temperature difference in a very uneconomical manner, but we could only say that we have achieved and maintained a large temperature difference if it is economically feasible; in other words, the economic benefits derived from such a large temperature difference should be greater than the cost of maintaining it. I propose this question as my research deals with nuclear fusion. A prerequisite of nuclear fusion is extremely high temperature plasmas, which need to be maintained at approximately 100 million degrees. Since the plasmas will have to be maintained within a limited space, it will need to be enclosed by walls. Furthermore, the temperature of the walls should be reduced from 100 million degrees to several hundred degrees within short distances. For many, a temperature of 100 million degrees may be rather unfamiliar. For comparison, temperature of the Sun’s surface is around 5,000~6,000 degrees, and its core is estimated to be around 15 million degrees. The temperature of plasma, on the other hand, is about seven to ten times higher than even the Sun’s core. Nature, which likes to maintain an equilibrium state, abhors such tremendous temperature gradients. When humans try to force such a temperature gradients and maintain it, nature will try to achieve an equilibrium state very quickly through a phenomenon known as turbulence. From nature’s point of view, turbulence is an incredibly effective means of achieving an equilibrium. Common examples that we may be familiar with include typhoons and hurricanes. 
                        In nuclear fusion research area, there is a device known as a tokamak. Inside this device, extreme temperature gradients are formed as the temperature can vary from 10 million degrees to several hundred degrees within distances as short as 50cm to 1m. This causes nature (the plasmas) to generate turbulence. Many studies are underway to develop technologies to control this turbulence and maintain a temperature of 10 to 100 million degrees while complying with nature. Although I discussed the topic from the standpoint of my field of research, the idea of maintaining a temperature difference while complying with nature may implicate that, in the future, humans could control natural disasters such as typhoons or hurricanes while staying within the boundaries of nature. I believe that this ultimate question may help us in understanding and developing such techniques in the future. Thank you.
