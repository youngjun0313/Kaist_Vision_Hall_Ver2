                        The human genome consists of 6 x 109 base pairs (6 giga base pairs) and is divided among 46 chromosomes that are folded in the cell nucleus. As Watson and Crick described in their DNA double helix theory in 1953, each DNA base pair is 0.34 nm (0.34 x 10-9m) in length, which means 6 giga base pairs result in a total length of about 2 m. Putting this into perspective, this is like fitting 40 km of string into a ball the size of our fist. Then how can 2 m of DNA fold perfectly in a nucleus with a diameter of only 6 μm, even being able to replicate and divide according to the 24-hour cell cycle? This remains an important fundamental question to this day, despite the numerous ways in which the 3D structures of chromosomes can be examined.<br>
                        Since cells were first observed through a microscope in 1902, the question regarding the formation of chromosomes, a type of genetic material that can be showed with specific dyes, has persisted for over a century. With the discovery of nucleosomes, we have built up some level of understanding on initial folding phenomena for chromosome formation. However, we have only begun to scratch the surface when it comes to understanding the molecular mechanisms that are involved in folding interphase chromosomes over 10,000 times during cell division to form chromosomes (a process that constitutes a large portion of the cell cycle). What physical or biochemical laws and molecular mechanisms are involved in forming and maintaining such a condensed structure, and how is our genome maintained since the birth of life?<br> 
                        Incorrectly folded chromosomes lead to cell death, and as such this may be an important stepping-stone to better understand and treat various fatal diseases. If we can develop physical and biochemical theories regarding such small scales and variable folding, we may be able to develop technologies that can allow us to fit and remove various substances from small spaces. From a medical point of view, this will pave the way to achieving the ability to physically suppress the expression and silencing of gene clusters with direct and precise control. Moreover, in contrast to multi-level technologies that are stacked on top of each other to increase the capacity of NAND flash memory, we may be able to develop new and transcendent technology based on ultimate theories derived from knowledge of chromosome folding.
