                        The Earth has access to various sources of energy. Examples include heat energy from the Sun, tidal forces arising from periodic vertical movements of seawater due to the attraction between the Earth-Moon-Sun, and wind power that stems from wind forces generated due to density and heat capacity differences between air and water. When considering the contribution of a given form of energy according to scales of time and space, we can assume that global-scale changes are most affected by the various forms of energy that are transferred to the oceans (which consist of an immense amount of fluid). The energy being absorbed moves through space and time to maintain the Earth’s homeostasis and energy equilibrium through various physical phenomena; however, the details of this process remain unknown. More specifically, heat energy that is absorbed by the ocean moves along with ocean currents between the equator and the polar icecaps, maintaining variability and balance. Furthermore, the potential energy derived from density variations in the vertical direction and the kinetic energy arising from fluid motion result in physical phenomena such as turbulence, eddy currents, and internal waves. Tides, which are periodic vertical shifts in the sea level, combine with currents in the horizontal direction to form waves, and friction due to wind blowing above the ocean is transferred to the ocean’s surface and shallow depths as kinetic energy, resulting in local and global ocean circulation. Additionally, the oceans on the rotating Earth’s surface are considered as a moving flow in a rotating reference frame, and the resulting Coriolis forces produce ocean flow and waves with an inertial period. Through these types of phenomena, energy dissipates from initial large amounts as it progresses forward, whereas energy grows larger as it moves in the reverse direction through large-scale ocean flow. The ultimate question that I propose asks how all this energy maintains Earth’s homeostasis and equilibrium. <br>
                        Research on the pathways of energy absorbed by the ocean and physical phenomena such as turbulence has been ongoing for centuries. While there have been reports on small, sub-meter-scale 3-dimensional turbulence tests in laboratories as well as studies on physical phenomena through actual observations of hundreds of kilometers of the ocean surface using remote detection satellites, we have yet to achieve an adequate level of understanding of ocean currents at a kilometer scale between the aforementioned study scales. This type of research would allow us to understand energy pathways and how energy is dissipated by calculating the energy balance of physical ocean phenomena that occur at various scales. Based on a better understanding of various scales of turbulence, we may be able to predict global ocean and climate variations. All in all, this ultimate question will emphasize to KAIST members the need for research that covers large-scale natural phenomena as well as a foundation for balance research. <br>
