                        The “Ultimate Question” I propose is, “Can we monitor everything that enters and leaves our body in real time?” By “everything,” I am referring to all kinds of information, such as the calories of the food we eat, fine dust particles in the air we breathe, and pathogens like bacteria and viruses. The current global pandemic led me to this question. At the time of this interview in February 2020, the threat of the novel coronavirus disease has spread fear across the globe. Authorities are warning of asymptomatic carriers who can unknowingly spread the disease to others, and the entire nation is on edge as it conducts epidemiological studies and tracks infection pathways. I have come to ponder how this situation would have been different if we could detect pathogen information in real time by accurately determining information regarding what is let in by our bodies. <br>
                        On a different note, we always start the new year with the resolve to lose weight. However, most, if not all, people fail in this quest and give up on their diet. I began wondering if this was an issue of not knowing information regarding the calorie intake into our bodies rather than not knowing information regarding the calories we burn. Thanks to advancements in smart devices, we now have a relatively firmer grasp on information regarding the calories we burn, yet it remains difficult to accurately determine the number of calories we consume. I believe that the health sector and the medical society can greatly benefit from technologies that enable us to accurately determine information regarding what enters our bodies. To answer this ultimate question, we will need to conduct research in the following manner. I believe that with deep insight and access to expertise, this type of research could be helmed by those in basic research fields related to biology, such as medical science, biological sciences, or bio and brain engineering. On the other hand, this research could be approached by chemical and biomolecular engineers who regard a human body as a chemical plant and all metabolic activity as chemical reactions. Sensing devices could be approached from various disciplines, such as materials science and engineering, chemical and biomolecular engineering, electrical engineering, or mechanical engineering. In other words, I believe that we need a cross-disciplinary approach that intersects multiple disciplines to answer this ultimate question. Thank you.
