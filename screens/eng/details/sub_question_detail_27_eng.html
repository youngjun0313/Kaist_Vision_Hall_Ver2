                        In hospitals, doctors often use X-ray or ultrasound imaging devices to look inside a patient’s body. Waves such as X-rays and ultrasound can penetrate the body, allowing doctors to observe internal lesions directly.<br>
                        However, light has completely different properties inside our body. Similar to how we cannot see distant objects during a foggy day due to light scattering, we cannot observe our internal organs and blood vessels with the naked eye. The scattering phenomenon occurs when light is reflected and scattered due to small particles. Under foggy conditions, small water droplets in the air cause light to scatter. Inside our body, this is caused by both cells in living tissue as well as their organelles, such as the nucleus and mitochondria. Another example of scattering involves the distortion of water waves when they collide with rocks.<br>
                        My research aims to develop glasses that can see inside our bodies. If we measure the scattered light in advance, we can cancel the scattering phenomenon in a manner similar to how noise-cancelling earphones cancel outside noise. This process can also be pictured as a time-reversal phenomenon that reverses the scattering of light taking place inside the body. Current optics technology is only able to observe targets at shallow depths of up to 0.1mm beneath the surface of the skin, but with this research, we may potentially be able to observe inside our internal organs and even the brain. Because optical imaging techniques provide greater resolution and contrast compared to other imaging modalities, doctors may be able to diagnose incurable diseases such as cancer or stroke in very early stages using our scattering-cancelling glasses.
