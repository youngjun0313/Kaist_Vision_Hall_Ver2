                        Since 2006, North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests. An essential part of North Korea’s nuclear weapons development program involves securing weapons-grade plutonium and highly enriched uranium, which can trigger fission reactions. After the irradiation of uranium in a graphite-moderated reactor, North Korea used reprocessing technology to separate high-purity plutonium from nuclear fuel. Furthermore, North Korea used enrichment technology to enrich natural uranium-235 to produce highly enriched uranium with concentrations of 90% or higher. However, while countries such as North Korea use nuclear fuel reprocessing and uranium enrichment technologies for military purposes, the truth is that similar technologies are required for peaceful nuclear energy generation. Of course, peaceful nuclear applications use lower purity plutonium and low-enriched uranium, but there is always a concern that reprocessing and enrichment technologies could be diverted for military purposes. As a consequence, the international community has placed rules to restrict the proliferation of these technologies. If we could develop a type of enrichment technology that can produce low-enriched uranium for nuclear reactors but not highly enriched uranium required for nuclear weapons, or if we could develop new reprocessing technologies that can recycle spent fuel but not be used to extract pure plutonium, then we could put an end to the idea that nuclear energy is linked to nuclear proliferation. This would allow us to develop novel nuclear technology without the need to be concerned about nuclear proliferation. Moreover, such developments could potentially help reduce public fear towards nuclear energy.
