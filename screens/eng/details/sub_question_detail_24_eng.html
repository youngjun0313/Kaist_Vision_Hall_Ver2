                        Could we make rechargeable batteries run on nuclear energy? Hello, I am Professor Jeong Ik Lee from the Department of Nuclear & Quantum Engineering of KAIST, and I will explain what my question means. Most devices that we use in our everyday life, such as a TV remote control or watches, run on batteries. These batteries are usually primary cells, which means they cannot be recharged and are only used once and then discarded. There is also another class of cells known as secondary cells. These are rechargeable batteries that we can find in our smartphones and laptops. Although these batteries can be freely discharged and recharged, this cycle cannot be repeated an unlimited number of times. Even rechargeable batteries only last as long as their designed cycle life. Primary and secondary cells store electrical energy through chemical reactions of materials. Electricity is generated when needed by converting the stored chemical energy into electrical energy. In the case of secondary cells, electrical energy can be stored as chemical energy and converted back to electrical energy when it is needed. <br>
                        There is a type of battery that involves a similar yet completely different reaction: nuclear batteries. These types of batteries are currently used for applications in deep space exploration, such as to power machinery for Mars exploration missions. Nuclear batteries are characterized by the generation of electrical energy through nuclear reactions: more specifically, energy is produced through radioactive decay. A property of radioactive decay is that once it is initiated, it cannot be halted. This means that we cannot simply turn off the battery. Thus, it is non-rechargeable like primary cells. However, nuclear batteries are a stable source of energy that lasts several years, and thus are ideal for deep space exploration missions, which can last 10 or even 20 years. <br>
                        While nuclear batteries are presently used in this manner, my ultimate question is whether we can develop rechargeable batteries that run on nuclear energy. Nuclear batteries used in space missions are mostly primary cells that can only be used once, and while they last for long periods of time, we cannot freely turn a nuclear battery on and off. Furthermore, nuclear batteries cannot be recharged. Therefore, my ultimate question asks the following: Can we develop rechargeable batteries that run on nuclear energy and are capable of freely storing electrical energy for use when needed?<br>
