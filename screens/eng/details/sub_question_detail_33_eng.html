                        In his book, “How the Mind Works (Dongnyok Science, 2007),” Steven Pinker compares the way the mind or brain works to a computer program. Under this comparison, the information in our brain could be viewed as data. Then, could we download all data stored in an individual’s brain and transfer it to a machine or even the brain of another person? By achieving this level of technology, we would reach the singularity that Ray Kurzweil described in his book, “The Singularity Is Near (Gimmyoung Publishers, 2007).”<br>
                        Many researchers are undertaking research to answer this question; however, most studies are not within my research field, so I am not too aware of the type or depth of research being conducted. Nevertheless, as someone known for curiosity, I have pondered this question for a while, and I know many others share similar questions. We can see many movies and TV shows where a character loses their body but lives on by downloading all of their memories and knowledge to exist forever either in virtual reality or within a machine. For example, this is the premise of the BBC drama “Years and Years,” which takes place 15 years in the future, during a time when human minds can be transferred to machines. The British drama “Black Mirror” features an episode titled “San Junipero,” in which terminal patients upload their brains’ information to a virtual space to decide whether to live in that reality for eternity. In other words, the patients get to choose the life they want to live after death. Mankind has many vague images about the afterlife due to various religious influences; one could say that the aforementioned dramas depict a potential afterlife in the digital age. Even in cinema we can see similar ideas, as in the case of “Source Code” or “Lucy”, which portray humans becoming one with machines. <br>
                        The potential of our information lasting forever will not only transform our lives, but society as a whole. As portrayed in “Years and Years,” we could upload a person’s brain data to an AI speaker to communicate with that person even after their death. From a knowledge accumulation perspective, this type of technology could ensure that no knowledge is ever lost. In our personal lives, it can be said without doubt that such major changes will dramatically affect how we view our own lives, our family, and those around us. <br>
                        As we saw with the advancement of computer hardware that followed “Moore’s Law”, I believe that we are not too far from developing spaces to store all human brain data, despite how far behind we may seem to be from achieving this level of technology. Then we can ask, how far are we from realizing the concept of downloading this information, as depicted in the aforementioned TV shows and movies? If it is indeed impossible, why? These are the ultimate questions that I have always wondered about, but unfortunately, I have yet to find an answer.<br>
