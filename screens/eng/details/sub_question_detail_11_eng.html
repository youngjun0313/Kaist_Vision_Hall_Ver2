                        Hello, I am Professor Sunkyu Han from the Department of Chemistry. The ultimate question that I would like to propose explores the idea of synthesizing drugs by simply mixing solutions containing various chemical ingredients. I proposed this question as it is closely related to my research. My lab and I conduct research on the synthesis of natural products with complex structures. Long and delicate processes involving numerous reaction stages are required to combine simple building blocks into natural products with complex structures. In many cases, not only is the process long, but it also requires a lot of effort and care to finally arrive at the desired product. As I was conducting my research, I imagined the possibility of simply mixing all ingredients and building blocks together and stirring the contents to produce compounds with specific structures. This was the inspiration behind my ultimate question. <br>
                        Indeed, this method of producing complex structures is not mere fantasy, as it is known to take place in our bodies as well as in nature. For a start, DNA serves as a blueprint that determines proteins’ structures in our bodies. Based on this blueprint, ribosomes act as biological devices that naturally synthesize proteins with complex structures from aqueous solutions containing various constituents (amino acid building blocks). Natural products are also produced in a similar manner. Then, could humans artificially mimic such mechanisms to synthesize complex natural compounds? This is an idea shared by many researchers. Since the 2000s, there have been numerous studies on the subject of DNA-templated synthesis that aimed to synthesize complex natural products through methods similar to those found in nature. However, despite that it was shown to be possible to produce simple molecules in small quantity, scalability proved to be an issue as there were fundamental and technical limitations when attempting to increase production to industrially feasible levels. If we can overcome the technical limitations and further develop the idea to practically viable levels, this would be an incredibly meaningful achievement. Let us consider how such developments would transform our lives. From an industrial perspective, the mass production of drugs or organic materials at the factory level usually involves numerous reactions, each of which takes time and incurs significant costs. If we consider a process with ten reactions, then the potential benefits of being able to mix all constituents into a single flask and using a blueprint molecule to sequentially perform all ten reactions would be unprecedented. Academically, I firmly believe such an accomplishment would be worthy of a Nobel Prize.
