                        Hello, I am Martin Ziegler: former associate professor of Mathematics at TU Darmstadt in Germany and since five years proud associate professor of Computer Science at KAIST.
                        For decades, Engineers have worked hard to make computations fully deterministic -- and they have succeeded!
                        In contemporary PCs, millions of transistors switch billions of times, every single second, for weeks: 
                        reliability of order 10^20.
                        Conversely various forms of NON-determinism have turned out to yield elegant and efficient algorithms:
                        in theory, but their practical realizability is more than questionable.
                        1. This of course amounts to the notorious P/NP millennium prize problem; 
                        2. and to the efficient generation of TRULY random bits.
                        3. Quantum computers constitute a promising blend between both. 
                        My question asks for a rigorous mathematical/computer scientific comparison of the powers of: 
                        0. deterministic, 1. randomized, 2. quantum, and 3. nondeterministic computation.
                        This is extremely ambitious: For over 50 years,
                        the smartest people in the world have tried, 
                        and failed, to solve any of these questions!
                        In fact these questions about Computer Science 
                        are actually deeply rooted in Mathematics:
                        both their rigorous formalization and their expected solution.
                        And the impact of this Mathematics will be enormous! 
                        I am not talking about superficial fame or money.
                        1. Solving P/NP can confirm or destroy cryptography and online banking as we know it.
                        2. Less obvious, randomized algorithms underlie so many programs or protocols:
                        apparently working well in practice,
                        but without scientific justification
                        due to the prevalence of PSEUDO-random number generators.
                        3. So far only Quantum Computer have been demonstrated to produce truly random bits;
                        and only that: Shor's and other "popular quantum algorithms" 
                        both remain out of reach in practice and without proven theoretical benefit.
                        Returning to P/NP, recent research has focused on mathematical theorems 
                        that prove certain proof techniques INsufficient to solve the question.
                        We thus follow Sherlock Holmes' advice:
                        "Once you eliminate the IMpossible, whatever remains, 
                        no matter how IMprobable, MUST be the truth."
                        Also we have tried many such approaches over the past years; and failed, too.
                        Yet until this very day we keep coming up with, and following, exciting new approaches!
                        Like any creative work, and much like an artist, scientific progress requires inspiration:
                        and inspiration cannot be forced, pushed, or accelerated.
                        Similar to cupid's arrow of love, inspiration hits UNexpectedly;
                        it grows, stalls, transforms, rises again: 
                        But every single idea has eventually turned out to be useful.
                        This is the principle of SERENDIPIDY, which underlies for example also the discovery
                        of Penicillin, of Teflon coating, of the DNA helix, of RSA cryptography etc.
                        The above questions thus are long hauls, 
                        INcompatible with common administrative or funding regulations.
                        A student thesis project on the other hand MUST be feasible, and within a given time frame. 
                        As responsible advisor, I deliberately have NO student working on the above questions.
                        Or so they think.
                        In fact, I do regularly "hide" certain aspects of these problems in students' projects:
                        sometimes more visible (making them begin to wonder), but usually much less apparent.
                        So anyone in my lab might be in for a surprise, since so far nobody has found the ticket.
