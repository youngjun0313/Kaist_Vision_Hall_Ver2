                        As we are all currently witnessing and experiencing first hand, the COVID-19 pandemic is not merely a health and medical issue, but a major threat to humanity that has brought about significant social and economic problems around the world. Although we do not know the consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic yet, this pandemic will be finished sometime in the future. However, even with the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, can we say that we are completely free from newly emerging viruses? Looking back to recent history, several outbreaks of newly emerging viruses have taken place in the past two decades, including SARS, MERS, Ebola, and Zika virus. Considering this history, we can be certain that newly emerging viruses will appear again in near future even after the termination of the COVID-19 pandemic. We then have to ask, ‘How can we prepare for the next pandemic?’ The best countermeasure is a preventive vaccine. However, we cannot simply produce a vaccine within a few days or even a few weeks; vaccine development is a long process that requires multi-step clinical tests. Then what is the best alternative measure? Vaccines are still our best weapon against viruses. Therefore, although it may sound nonsense, I propose the idea of preemptive vaccine development for novel viruses that may emerge in the future. One might ask, ‘How can we develop vaccines against novel viruses that we do not even know exist?’ However, by conducting extensive research in the present, we can make predictions regarding a range of potential novel viruses that are more likely to appear in the future. We could also design vaccines to provide immunity for a wide range of potential candidate viruses. More than ever, people around the world understand the importance of vaccines, and thus we must work to answer the ultimate question of ‘Can we develop preventive vaccines against newly emerging viruses in advance?’
