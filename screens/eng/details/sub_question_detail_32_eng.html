                        The question I propose as a KAIST Ultimate Question is “Can we determine a material’s destiny from its shape?” Many people turn to things like facial fortune-telling to try and learn more about their destiny. This is based on the belief that there is a connection between a person’s facial details and their personality as well as their destiny. In the case of materials, ’facial details’ could be interpreted as a material’s structure, while ’personality’ could be viewed as its properties. We know that there are strong correlations between a material’s structure and its properties. The same can be said between a material’s properties and how it ends up being applied: in other words, its destiny. We can achieve a form of ’material facial fortune-telling’ by using AI such as AlphaZero to systematically analyze these connections. This is an innovative tool that could be used to easily obtain structural blueprints of new materials with desirable properties. How then is the structure of a material determined? To answer this question, we need to understand that elements form the basic building blocks of materials. More specifically, a new material is synthesized by selecting various elements from Mendeleev’s periodic table and chemically bonding them, repeating the process until the material is obtained. In other words, a material’s structure is basically the arrangement of atoms in space. New materials are produced by combining solid, liquid, and gaseous elements while optimizing the temperature, pressure, and mixing ratios. Up until now, the development process has begun with experiment design, where the relationships between various factors are determined. Once the new material has been synthesized, various microscopy techniques are employed to analyze whether the material has the desired structure and satisfies the property specifications. However, with the advent of the 4th Industrial Revolution, the rise of AI and additive manufacturing technology (such as 3D printing) has brought about innovative paradigm shifts in the design and synthesis of new materials. Furthermore, the development of atomic force microscopy now enables us to easily visualize atomic and molecular structures in real time, and we are now in an era where we can measure multi-scale properties at the molecular level and at scales visible to the naked eye. Under this new paradigm, we need to develop new materials by actively considering the actual usage conditions and potential consumers during the design stage. Moreover, experts capable of conducting simulations, measurements, and evaluations of multi-scale properties should focus on transdisciplinary research. If we can solve the proposed question through such efforts, Korean companies will attain advantageous positions in the growing market of novel materials. Lastly, I look forward to seeing new forms of startup companies led by young entrepreneurs such as on-demand material and process solution providers. Thank you.
