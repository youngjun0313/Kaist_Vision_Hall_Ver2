                    <p align="justify">The human body has about 40 trillion cells. All types of cells originate from a single fertilized egg and share a nearly identical sequence of chromosomes. How do cells with the same set of genes differentiate into skin, bones, eyes, internal organs, and even cancer cells? This question has been a subject of curiosity and research among scientists for decades. The biology field, known as development, describes the many details and great beauty behind the highly complicated process of how a single fertilized egg becomes an organism. Even basic research for cancer treatment is a process of answering how normal cells change into cancer cells. <br>
                        Many medical scientists are developing methods of replacing damaged tissue due to accidents or diseases using cells commonly obtained from a patient’s body to avoid an immune rejection response. Medical doctor and scientist Shinya Yamanaka discovered that differentiated cells could undergo de-differentiation when a few genes are over-expressed in the cells. These renewed cells regain the ability to differentiate into various other cells and generate new tissues. For his achievement, Dr. Yamanaka was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2012. However, despite such research results, we have yet to regenerate damaged tissues such as nerves and hearts because we do not know the fundamental mechanism of how the cells are differentiated into specific types.<br>
                        Therefore, we need to understand how cells are differentiated into specific cells to develop tissue engineering techonology. Most importantly, we require a better understanding of what takes place within cells at the molecule level. As a biochemist who studies basic science, I am currently studying biomolecular interactions related to biological phenomena. More specifically, my objectives are to understand how certain genes are exclusively chosen from thousands of genes within chromosomes to differentiate into specific cell types. For this purpose, my research employs cryogenic electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography to study the structures of the protein complexes related to the RNA transcription process within cells at sub-nanometer resolution. As such, my ultimate question is as follows: How do cells with the same DNA change into various types of cells? <br>
