                        The Ultimate Question I wish to suggest is something I have always pondered throughout my career. Whether it be stem cells differentiating into specific types of cells, young cells changing into aged cells as time goes on, or the process by which normal cells undergo carcinogenesis due to an accumulation of genetic mutations, all of these biological phenomena, despite having different causes and processes, have the common trait of being irreversible in their natural state. However, in the case of stem cell differentiation, it has been proven that terminally differentiated cells can be restored to their original stem cell state through specific artificial manipulation. In 2006, the Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka demonstrated that it was possible to restore terminally differentiated fibroblasts to their original artificial pluripotent stem cell state via reprogramming by introducing four factors to fibroblasts from rats. In 2007, Yamanaka succeeded in reprogramming human skin cells, proving that dedifferentiation was possible. For his research accomplishments, Yamanaka was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2012. However, reversibility remains a scientific challenge in the fields of ageing and carcinogenesis. <br>
                        Major advancements in system biology research in the 21st century have brought us steadily closer to grasping the principles that control such complex biological phenomena. We now know that a wide array of biological phenomena are controlled by complex control networks that are built upon various interactions between the multitude of constituent factors that make up organisms. Although biological phenomena that are controlled by these so-called complex networks pose challenges when trying to accurately understand fundamental principles, they do have many flexible characteristics. While a biological phenomenon is a result of a specific process, there are many other control factors that exist in the complex network, some of which could be manipulated to return the biological phenomenon to its original state. <br>
                        Ageing is described at the cell level as entering a specific stage called cellular senescence, which is referred to as permanent cell cycle arrest. As the name suggests, upon entering this state, a cell permanently remains in cell cycle arrest. However, in a series of recent studies, it has been reported that specific stimuli could potentially alter cells that are entering into the cellular senescence state into a state where cell division resumes. In the case of carcinogenesis, a Swiss pathologist published a report over 100 years ago where ovarian cancer could be restored to normal tissue cells under very specific conditions. Historically, there have been several reported cases of cancer cells or cancerous tissue being restored to normal tissue states under extremely specific conditions. However, we are still unaware of what changes occur within cells under such specific environments or conditions and how such phenomena are reversed. <br>
                        Nevertheless, with advancements in system biology research as well as recent rapid developments in technologies such as single cell analysis, which can measure molecular states with extreme precision, we may soon be able to discover new breakthroughs. By understanding the principles behind complex networks that control actual biological phenomena within cells based on data measurements, we may be able to find regulators that could allow us to artificially reverse such biological phenomena. As a result, we may find that there are common principles between biological phenomena that have long been considered irreversible, and I believe we can use these breakthroughs to develop control technologies that can reverse such phenomena. <br>
                        Thank you.
