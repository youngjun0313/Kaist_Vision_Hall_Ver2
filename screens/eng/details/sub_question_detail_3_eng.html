                        I pondered the question “Do human brains, animal brains, and artificial intelligence use the same logic system?” If we elaborate on this question, we could ask whether our scientific logic is absolute or if it can vary in a relative manner depending on how the brain processes information. Let us take a look at an example. Syllogism is an often-cited example of logical reasoning: if A is B, and B is C, then A is C. This logic seems self-explanatory based on our system of thought. But how did we reach the conclusion that it is self-explanatory without question? A key point is that this conclusion always holds because the outputs reached by our brain’s logic are always constant when this argument is substituted. Here we can conduct a thought experiment. If we assume there is an intellectual system that works in a completely different way from the human brain, would our logic systems and mathematical and scientific axioms remain true in this system? In classical physics, we used to believe that time and space were absolute until Einstein introduced the concept of relativity. In modern physics, which is based on the theory of relativity, we learned to accept that space-time is relative and that our interpretation of the universe could completely change. The original question is derived from the philosophy that our mathematical and scientific logic is based on how the human brain is structured and functions. Under logic systems of other organisms or artificially created brains - which performs intellectual functions in a similar manner with the human brain, but function in a completely different manner – our axioms that seem to be obviously self-explanatory could potentially be no longer true. This raises the question of whether a novel logic system, completely different from our logics, could potentially exist. From the notion that the logic that constitutes our system of thought is ultimately based on how our brain works, we can say that the world we see and understand - and even our logics and scientific knowledge - are the images created and constrained by our brain.
