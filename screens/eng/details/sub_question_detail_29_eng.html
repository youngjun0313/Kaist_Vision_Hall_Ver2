                        My ultimate question is related to new methods of seeing within the human body. In modern medicine, anatomical information of the human body can be obtained through methods such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI, which are actively used in diagnosis and treatment. However, no new method has emerged in the past fifty years. This is similar to how rubber tires still remain important components of modern vehicles and transportation despite having been invented more than a century ago. CT scanning has the advantage of quick scan times and can produce 3D images with high resolution, but there is the potential risk of X-ray exposure if excessive scans are performed. MRI also produces high-resolution images with superior soft tissue discrimination, but the scans take a long time to complete. Of course, we could say that we can solve these issues by minimizing the CT radiation dose or by developing ways of significantly reducing MRI scan times, but perhaps there are novel imaging techniques that we have yet to discover or have overlooked. No matter how hard we try, we cannot look into our bodies with the naked eye. Reactions such as penetration, reflection, or absorption with a probing media are inevitably required, and this must be accompanied by a physical phenomenon that we can define as a signal to explore inside the human body. CT and MRI are based on the use of electromagnetic waves or radiation with high penetrating power as well as a nuclear magnetic response to observe radio wave energy absorption rates. As such, I look forward to the possibility of new imaging techniques being developed by those who research optics, ultrasound, electric and magnetic fields, or other disciplines. While all of these disciplines are already deeply embedded in modern medical imaging applications, we have yet to realize an alternative that exceeds the capabilities of CT or MRI. It would also be meaningful to examine the interactions of various probing media. We may be able to gain insights by studying technologies from completely different fields, or we could potentially establish new domains for new medium reactions.
