                        I considered the question of how we can ensure the ethical conduct of AI. In general, existing AI undertake or avoid actions based on an objective function that has been preset. However, such methods will lead to challenges in implementing complex behavior patterns that cannot simply be defined by an objective function. For example, how can we mathematically describe our general ethics system? Clearly, it is difficult to develop an AI that acts in an ethical manner according to set simple “rules”. From a historical perspective, such problems were being discussed in detail even as early as the 1940s. Isaac Asimov, a science fiction writer and futurist, is well known for his proposal of the ‘Three Laws of Robotics’, in which methods of controlling AI for protecting humans were suggested. However, while this famous idea became an example of a principle that must accompany AI development, it could not completely prevent logical contradictions in various situations. Furthermore, it could not resolve issues arising from the absence of a specific methodology for implementation. On the other hand, we can try to teach AI, relying on data from various situations, using conventional approaches such as current deep learning models. However, as we saw in the case of Tay, a chatbot developed by Microsoft company several years ago, it is fundamentally impossible to rule out the possibility of being conditioned to act in unethical ways by learning off biased data. This is only one of those numerous examples that reveal how difficult it is to develop ethical AI. AIs in the future will steadily be used to address complex problems that are currently being handled by humans, and in this process, a wide array of ethical decisions will need to be made. As such, it is crucial that we set ethical principles installed by default in all AI. Furthermore, we will need to develop technologies for the implementation of such ethical principles in different forms applicable to machines.
