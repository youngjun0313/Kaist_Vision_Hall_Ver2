                        Hello, my name is Yannis Semertzidis, professor of Physics at KAIST, but also the Director of the IBS Center for Axion and Precision Physics Research (CAPP).<br>
                        The aim of the Center is to answer one of the top most fundamental questions in particle physics today. That of Dark Matter.<br>
                        How do we know there is Dark Matter? The solar system is moving around our galaxy, the Milky Way, at the astonishing speed of 0.1% of the speed of light! That’s incredible. We are moving so fast. According to Newton, the mass that we see in the center of the Galaxy is not enough to hold us together. We should have been thrown out of it, but instead, there is an invisible glue that keeps us together and that is what we aim to find out. One of the most promising ways for the dark matter to exist is, we think, as a Cosmic MASER, the so-called axion. That is a form of an energy field oscillating at one specific frequency, anywhere between 1 GHz and 1 THz, just imagine!<br>
                        CAPP’s first target is the frequency range between 1 – 10 GHz. At around 2 GHz is what your cellphone works at, but axions, at best, give out only a very faint signal. Can we detect them? Can we make the invisible matter appear? Our method is to force axions to appear by turning on a very strong magnetic field in a very large volume enclosed by an incredibly high-quality factor microwave resonator; all the best in the world. At the end, even after we do those things, in order to read out that little energy that we get from vacuum, we still need to use quantum noise limited RF amplifiers to be able to detect a few photons per second. And when we detect the axions, we will open up a whole new field that of Axion-based astrophysics where we can see in real time how dark matter is distributed. How the dark matter streams are flowing over the earth in different directions, at different seasons, and so one big picture of the universe and the clues of our Galaxy dynamics will appear in front of us. Thank you very much.
