                        We often hear the idea that human history began when man first learned to use tools. This means that the development of our race greatly depended on how we made such tools. We call this process manufacturing. It is a connected process that begins by understanding which products are needed. We then produce these products and distribute them to where they are in demand. We can summarize this as a chain that links design, production, manufacturing, and distribution.<br>
                        In what ways then could we innovate the manufacturing process? Most notably, manufacturing processes are often dangerous and are sometimes hindered by human intervention. Then, could we potentially automate the entire process, so humans are not needed? This is the question that I propose. With the current COVID-19 pandemic running rampant, this issue was thrust into the spotlight earlier this year when the New York Times published an article criticizing the fact that the wealthiest nation in the world could not even properly produce masks.<br>
                        This is why I believe we need to give thought to this issue. How can we remove the need for humans, so we do not have to rely so heavily on low-income workers? How can we implement high-level technologies into manufacturing to be able  to manufacture goods on demand, potentially even achieving automation and developing autonomous factories? These are key questions that I hope we can soon find the answers to.<br>
