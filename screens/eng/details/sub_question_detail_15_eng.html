                        Creativity is a core human faculty that allows us to see the high-dimensional order hiding underneath the seemingly chaotic surface of nature. Physical theories such as Maxwell’s equations that succinctly express the principles of motion of numerous materials and objects are products of human creativity, as are Van Gogh’s Starry Night that revealed ed the striking beauty of the moon and the stars sprinkled over the sky.<br>
                        David Bohm, giant of quantum physics and the discoverer of plasma, claimed that creativity can empower humans to find their rightful place inside the universe, while Abraham Maslow, psychologist of the hierarchy-of-human-desire fame, said that self-actualization through creativity is the ultimate human goal in life. After the Industrial Revolution that satiated material human needs and the Information Revolution that fulfilled the human desire for communication and belonging, Science of Creativity is poised to kickstart a new Scientific Revolution that may finally unveil the full connection between human and nature, letting us  the meaning of life.<br>
                        The science of creativity requires a deep understanding of humanity, the interaction between human and nature, and the essential meaning of science and technology. It will play a pivotal role in the discovery of novel causes behind many mysteries of nature, leading to innovative solutions to numerous global problems that affect humanity. This is the new mission that KAIST, with its world-class expertise in science and the unrivaled capacity for interdisciplinary research on the human-science-culture complex, must undertake.<br>
