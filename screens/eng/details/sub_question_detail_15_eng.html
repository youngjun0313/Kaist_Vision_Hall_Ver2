                        On the intersection between both areas, Mathematics and Computer Science, is: Numerics.
                        Science, Engineering, Economics, and Mathematics itself: 
                        all involve complicated equations, that usually admit NO EXACT solution.
                        Instead, numerical calculations are used to solve them APPROXIMATELY
                        ---since the 1930ies, often as replacements of expensive/dangerous experiments.
                        1985 marked the beginning of a veritable Numerical Revolution:
                        35 years ago the IEEE 754 floating point standard was introduced,
                        immediately followed by hardware support that would drastically accelerate calculations:
                        a veritable pinnacle of Electrical Engineering!
                        These 35 years have seen computing evolve from a hackers' paradise to a scientific discipline. 
                        As Moore's Law is reaching its limitations, the goals of research in Computing have shifted: 
                        from raw "faster" and "bigger" to refined "convenient" and "rigorous" and "elegant";
                        from Electrical ENGINEERING to Computer SCIENCE:
                        * Design of algorithms has replaced heuristical "hacking"
                        * Bitcost analyses have replaced empirical timing measurements;
                        * Complexity theory allows to mathematically prove algorithms optimal;
                        * Formal verification has replaced testing and debugging.
                        * Abstract Data Types / OOP hide technical details (CPU, registers).
                        But this paradigm shift from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science 
                        has been restricted to the processing of DISCRETE data. For the past decades, 
                        Computer Science kept turning a blind eye on the processing of CONTINUOUS quantities
                        ---although these are ubiquitous in applications: scalar and vector fields, differential operators etc.
                        Still nowadays, continuous data is commonly treated by discretization. 
                        But discretizing a continuous problem adds artefacts and breaks symmetries as well as other beneficial properties of the original formulation.
                        For example floating point numbers violate the Associate and Distributive Law:
                        leading to many bugs burried in most numerical codes, such as those that led to the
                        collapse of the computer-designed Sleipner-A oil platform, failure of the Ariane V maiden flight 501.
                        Discretization voids all the reasons Real Calculus has been developed in the first place:
                        completeness, intermediate value and fixed point theorems.
                        We develop "Computer Science for Numerics":
                        in order to fill this huge blind spot in the science of processing continuous data, ready for the SECOND Numerical Revolution.
                        The iRRAM library, developed in Germany, supports real numbers as abstract data type: 
                        exactly, devoid of rounding errors, in full agreement with Mathematics.
                        It hides floating point computations behind a layer of clean and ideal abstractions,
                        just like high-level programming languages hide bits and bytes and processor details.
                        Building on the reliability of these exact real numbers
                        are vectors and matrices and tensors, polynomials;
                        converging sequences, analytic and smooth functions.
                        Mathematically these constitute "expansions of structures" in the sense of Model Theory;
                        computationally they form a hierarchy of continuous abstract data types.
                        Together they allow to transfer constructive proofs from Calculus I,II,III,IV directly and automatically into reliable algorithms.
                        IEEE 754 floating point numbers are a pinnacle of Electrical Engineering; like modern CPUs.
                        Computer Science has added the abstractions that allow for the convenience of contemporary computers.
                        Its powerful and rigorous methods underlie the development of large-scale software, such as Computer Algebra Systems.
                        We extend this to the development of a Computer ANALYSIS System:
                        Turnkey numerics combining the knowledge of world experts in Pure and Applied Mathematics with the reliability of Computer Science. Thank you!
