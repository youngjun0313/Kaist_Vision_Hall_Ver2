                        It is my pleasure to take part in the Ultimate Questions program organized by the Office of Research Affairs. When I was a graduate student at KAIST, we focused on understanding the questions proposed by other countries more advanced than Korea. To date, we have made a great advance in science and technology to now see that we ourselfves propose ultimate questions that will lead the world forward. <br>
                        My ultimate question asks “Could we learn to arbitrarily control the spatial arrangements of molecules or nanomaterials for the development of novel artificial functional devices?“ In fact, this is what our lab has discussed for the past 15 years and will continue in the furture. In materials science, the methods of producing novel substances or materials can be summarized into two major categories. The first involves the rearrangement of chemical bonds among the constitutional atoms by chemical reactions. The other is to produce a desired product from a large bulk material. Here, we propose a third method that involves the concept of assembling molecules or nanomaterials. In fact, molecular assembly already exists in nature as a principle that constitutes living organisms. Biomolecules, such as DNA and proteins, fulfill their complicated functions by molecular self-assembly behaviors. We would like to expand this to various arbitrary nanomaterials and molecules, through which we can develop a novel methodology for material discovery. We may greatly improve the performance of artificial devices. For example, we may be able to improve energy efficiency or open new pathways to more environmentally friendly technologies, offering novel solutions for global issues that we are urgently facing nowadays. Thank you.
