                        Do partial differential equations, such as the Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics, offer a means of ‘predicting’ or ‘understanding’ stadium waves? Further, how are stadium waves influenced by ‘external shocks’ or tertiary factors which are not related to soccer matches (such as lightning, thunder, and heavy rain)? <br>
                        The ‘wave’ problem, which initiated from a mathematician’ s Mozart-style playfulness, carries the same predicament as determining the relationship between wealth inequality and economic growth or business cycle fluctuations. In fact, solutions to this problem have, in part, been discovered independently in the field of macroeconomics and mathematics, respectively. This discussion correlates with the insights of Eugene P. Wigner, a 1963 Nobel Laureate in physics. In “Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences,” Wigner lucidly recounts the coincidental discovery of pure mathematical models and its serendipitous connection with natural science. <br>
                        The first main question pertaining to the mathematical model behind stadium waves has been approached in two ways. The first approach was proposed by Pierre-Louis Lions, a French mathematician and 1994 Fields Medal recipient. His approach, referred to as the ‘Mean Field Games,’ concerns the solution of a coupled system of ‘non-linear’ partial differential equations: a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, widely used for optimal control problems in continuous time, and a Kolmogorov forward equation, applied in stochastic calculus or Ito calculus. It is worthwhile to note that the Schrödinger equation is a ‘linear’ partial differential equation. <br>
                        The second approach, which was independently discovered by three macroeconomists, combines the theory of dynamic programming with Markov process theory in discrete time. The economists' approach is a model that determines aggregate savings and investment in the overall economy when individual consumers are driven by ‘precautionary savings motives’ (this is referred to as the Aiyagari-Huggett-Bewley model in the field of macroeconomics). The solution of this model can also be used to determine the paths of ‘stadium waves.’ In other words, the problem of ‘audience waves’ involves simultaneously solving two sub-problems: the former is concerned with whether individual members of a stadium crowd will decide to remain seated to focus on the match or join in with the waves due to the atmosphere at the stadium, and the latter is concerned with a ‘probability density’ issue of how the ‘average sum’ of individual decisions amid the crowd effects the waves. <br>
                        As such, economic reasoning can be applied to the problem of audience waves based on two concepts in macroeconomics: first, the notion of individual optimization gauges whether each consumer will either save more (due to the fear of unemployment or accidents) or maintain spending, and, second, the notion of probability density tracks how the ‘average sum’ of individual consumers' savings and spending will effect the overall economy. Then how can we address the second question of how ‘stadium waves’ are influenced by the rise of ‘external shocks’ that are unrelated to the actual match itself? <br>
                        The answer to the second question is still undetermined. To borrow a mathematical term, this is a ‘millennium problem.’ In addition to the aforementioned Hamilton Jacobi-Bellman and Kolmogorov equations, another equation is required to determine the ‘probability density’ of ‘probability densities’ pertaining to potential ‘external shocks.’ Despite numerous attempts to solve this conundrum, uncovering such an equation remains elusive. <br>
                        The problem of stadium waves being effected by ‘external shocks’ resembles the economic forecasting problem of central banks. Most notably, the problem is almost identical to the macroeconomic forecasting problem we face today in a presumably ‘unequal society.’ In the advent of external shocks that are seemingly unrelated to economic activities in nature, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, what repercussions do consumers with precautionary savings motives have on the national savings and investment of an economy? Since a solution which addresses the relationship between stadium waves and ‘external forces’ is nonexistent, central banks are only able to propose ad hoc macroeconomic predictions based on approximate solutions of the unsolved problem. If anyone here can crack a solution to this conundrum, you will be recognized for your findings in a similar manner as the ‘crazy’ mathematician John Nash. Nash received the Nobel Prize in economics for his discovery of the ‘Nash equilibrium’ in game theory and inspired the creation of a Hollywood-type film entitled ‘A Beautiful Mind.’ <br>
