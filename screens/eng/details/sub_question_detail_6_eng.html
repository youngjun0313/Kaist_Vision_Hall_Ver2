                        Hi, I am Professor Young Seok Ju from the KAIST Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering. First, I would like to say that I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the KAIST Ultimate Questions program in celebration of KAIST’s 50th anniversary. My ultimate question is “How is the developmental process of the human body programmed in the human genome?” We could say that the human body is a miniature universe in itself. Our body consists of trillions of cells of more than 200 specific types that have a specific function for maintaining homeostasis. For example, the cells in the digestive and respiratory systems enable the intake and removal of external substances into and from the body. In contrast, the cells in the circulatory system distribute oxygens and nutrients throughout the entire body. These cells are not simply aggregated, but organize a sophisticated system in the body. <br>
                        The complex human body is developmentally rooted back to a single cell: a fertilized egg formed by the combination of a sperm and an egg. During embryo development, the single-cell undergo continuous cell divisions for producing numerous cells. These cells differentiate to a specific type and migrate to a specific anatomical location for organizing an entire body. Although the developmental process of each individual is, in principle, an independent process, our body structures are highly similar. Therefore, the sophisticated process should be programmed in our genome, although it is not fully decipherable at the moment. How does our genome sequence code the developmental processes? Is it a knowable question? Our lab conducts research through single-cell genome analysis, and we look forward to finding clues that can help us better understand the human development process.<br>
